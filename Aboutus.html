      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>Ivy was founded by two siblings with an interest in photography. Their photos are put up on this website. The intial idea for ivy came from taking photos of birds on a terrace at home. Starting off with the common dove and pigeon, to stalking hummingbirds, they've walked a long road on a simple terrace, diving into a world of photography.</p>

            To them, photography is a way of life, a path some take to express themselves. No one can freeze time completely, but with photography, you can freeze moments and document them into something you may or may not call a masterpiece.
